# ICO

 What this ICO is?

I'm Dexaran from Ethereum Classic community. This ICO is my personal attempt to raise money to realize my ideas about the development of Ethereum Classic. I've been a volunteer developer since this project comes to existence. I don't agree with the current visions of the development of ETC, and it seems that we are moving in wrong direction.

I think that current situation is a result of an inefficient distribution of human resources, while two separate development groups work on the same things for two almost identical projects separately.

I'm afraid that this will lead to the fact that ETC will be considered a deprecated project, as soon as Ethereum carries out the next valuable update.



Main goals of this ICO are:


    1. Restore compatibility of GETH and GETH Classic.
    This will allow easier adoption of third-party services such are MetaMask and Mist. It will also allow easier adoption of future main upgrades such are Raiden, Swarm, precompiled contracts and Metropolis updates.

    2. PR Campaign.
    I believe that one of the most important things is the atmosphere in the community. Having investigated DASH, PIVX, DECRED, I came to the conclusion that it would be good to hold games, contests, art bounties and other social-oriented events. I think that it will be a good idea to spend a part of funds for small monthly bounties.

    3. Coding standard.
    This is one of the important things for contract developers. I think that we should review the coding standard that is currently described in Ethereum Docs and update it to improve contracts code readability. I think that we should base a new coding standard on time-tested GNU coding standard.

    4. Maintain developed projects.
    I'm aiming to finalize ECNS, ERC223 and DexNS. I need to hire a web-site developer to improve DexNS web interface, write a patch fo MyEtherWallet to support ECNS and maintain ERC223 if it will be needed.

    5. Token exchange.
    I want to finalize a Decentralized Token Exchange which is already in development.

    6. Protocol upgrades.
    We should prepare a code base for future protocol upgrades. I think that it will be a good idea to cooperate with Ethereum Foundation developers that are currently working on Raiden and SWARM.

    7. Governance system.
    I'm aiming to work in the named direction during the year. After the year will pass we will establish a smart-contract based voting, where DEX tokens would be used.

    On 1st September 2018 I will deploy a voting contract. Everyone can file an issue on github repo of DEX token. We will link github's issues with a smart contract to allow DEX owners to vote on the proposed goals. We will focus on developing top voted proposals.

Our reality shows that even one single developer can perform quite a complicated job. It's just a matter of time.

I will finalize my current projects in any cases, but I can't handle everything at once. I'm aiming to hire at least two developers to team up with me and work on protocol upgrades. I'd like to hire a web-site developer and an employee who will engage in socio-oriented work as well.

The success of the team depends on how much funds would be contributed during the ICO.
